=====

MMSPY is the driving engine of the conflict analysis module in the Megasite Management Toolsuite (MMT) [1]. 
The MMT is a project funded by the German Research center UFZ.

The project was mostly written in Python during 2009. The code was written first in Procedural style, and was hard
to expand, although it did. 
 
Two years later, I decided to re-write everything in an Object-Oriented Style, and enhance the perfomence 
of the code leveraging more NumPy functions and skipping many Python 'for' loops.
