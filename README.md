MMSPY is the driving engine of the conflict analysis module in the Mega Site Management Tool (MMT). 
The MMT is an EU funded project to develop an interactive system to support the decision making 
process in rehabilitating large scale contaminated land sites (Mega Sites).  

The project was mostly written in Python during 2009. The code was badly organized and badly documented.  

Two years later, I decided to re-write everything in an Object-Oriented Style, and enhance the perfomence 
of the code leveraging more NumPy functions and skipping many Python 'for' loops.

Unfortunately, due to unclarity regarding the Copyright of the input files, the are not included here. I intend
to include demo data sets in a short while, in the hope it will people understand what this code does.
